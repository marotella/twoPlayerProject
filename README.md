# Description:
This is a two player fighting game. Players can take turns choosing from three different actions: attack, special ability, and restore. When a players health drops to zero the other player is the winner.

# Technologies used:
I used HMTL, CSS, and Javascript. 

# Approach:
- I used a theme of early 90's action movies for a two player arcade fighting game. 
- I used CSS and DOM manipulation to provide user feedback with character selection and various attacks.
- DOM manipulaton also added to the game experience, with showing and hiding elements, calling sounds, and triggering funcitons with event listeners.

# User Stories:
- A user can choose their character on the character selection screen by selecting a button.
- A user can know if they win or lose with a message on the screen.
- A user can know their health through the use of a health bar.
- A user can know the attack was effective by getting sound as a feedback and alert message if the attack missed.
- A user is aware of their turn throughout the game.
- A user is only interacting with the elements needed for play.


# Next Steps:
In the future I would like to add a replay function and hide player buttons when it is not their turn. I would also like to have more animation or use of sprites for attacks.
