Description:
This is a two player fighting game. Players can take turns choosing from three different actions: attack, special ability, and restore. When a players health drops to zero the other player is the winner.

Technology used:
I used HMTL, CSS, and Javascript. DOM manipulaton added to the game experience, with showing and hiding elements, calling sounds, and triggering funcitons with event listeners.

User Stories:
As a player, I start with a start page that prompts the players to choose their character on the character selection screen by selecting a button.
As a player, I know if I win or lose with a message on the screen.
As a player, I can know my health so I don't have to remember on my own through the use of a health bar.
As a player, I know my attack was effective by getting sound as a feedback and alert message if I miss.
As a player I can choose my action when it is my turn by  using a button. 
As a player, I am only interacting with elements that help my play.


Future Stretch Goals:
In the future I would like to add a replay function and hide player buttons when it is not their turn. I would also like to have more animation or use of sprites for attacks.
